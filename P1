Request the user’s first name, last name and age.

Print out Welcome, <First-Name> <Last-Name> (<Age>) in a new line.

Variants
Print out Welcome, <First-Name> <Last-Name> (<Year-Of-Birth>).
Year-of-Birth is derived as Age subtracted from Current-Year.
Request the user’s gender.
Print out Welcome, <First-Name> [Son/Daughter] of <Last-Name> (<Year-Of-Birth>), where Son is printed out if male, and Daughter if female.


Things to Consider (Extras)
When receiving age input, to be used in an arithmetic operation, you’ll want to make sure it’s a number.
When dealing with making decisions based off text, be mindful of cases. A user might enter Female as their gender, which is equivalent to female, and same as FEMALE.
